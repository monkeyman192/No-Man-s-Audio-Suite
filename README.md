# No Man's Audio Editor by monkeyman192
Audio Editor, replacer and adder for No Man's Sky

Requires Python to run (Python 3, this is untested on python 2.7)
To play audio files from within the program `pyglet` is required. Download it from https://pypi.org/project/pyglet/ or if you have python installed on your path you can do `pip install pyglet`.
You will also require AVBin to playback the produced ogg file
This can be downloaded from here: http://avbin.github.io/AVbin/Home/Home.html

The recompilation of bnks is currently broken sorry. This will be fixed when I have the time to work on this.
