# No-Man-s-Audio-Suite
Audio Editor, replacer and adder for No Man's Sky

Requires Python to run (Python 3, this is untested on python 2.7)
To play audio files from within the program `pyglet` is required. Download it from https://pypi.org/project/pyglet/ or if you have python installed on your path you can do `pip install pyglet`.

The recompilation of bnks is currently broken sorry. This will be fixed when I have the time to work on this.
